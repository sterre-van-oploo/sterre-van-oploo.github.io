                <p>A miracle year, I was born. Unfortunately I was too young to be behind my pc coding away. I did not achieve anything great the following years besides learning to walk, talk and eat.</p>

                <p>When I was four I went to a primary school called <i>de bolster</i>, from there I discovered my creative side! I never stopped drawing and designing.</p>

                <p>After 8 years of primary school I went to the <i>Baanderherencollege</i> for 4 years. In the later years there I discovered my love for coding!</p>

                <h2>2021</h2>
                <p>I build my first pc (again with the help of my uncle) I had so much fun doing that, I loved watching the stats change depending on which game I played. From that point I really got interested in the <i>nerdy</i> stuff.</p>

                <h2>2022</h2>
                <p>My uncle seized that opportunity to introduce my to coding using the inspect element function. And I was so interested how it all worked and I began messing around in the code of random websites to see what it did. Eventually he downloaded VScode for me and a new world opened up. At the end of that year I made several websites. Two for an internship (again at my lovely uncle's) and a few other to learn and mess around. I only worked with HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h2>2023</h2>
                <p>I passed my exams! After the summer break I went to my dream school the <i>SintLucas</i> in Eindhoven. I choose a programming course where I had lessons in game-development and web-development. I made websites and games, I learned a little bit of javascript, java, C# and more HTML and CSS. I also learned that I want to dive deeper in the web-development rather then game.</p>

                <p>In my second year I choose the web-development course and have illustration/design lessons which I also use for designing websites! I also have Cambridge lessons so my english will be fluid.</p>

                <p>I am really trying to think and code <i>outside the box</i>, I'm still relatively new to javascript but I am learning every day! I love discovering new things and ways to better myself and my code :]</p>
