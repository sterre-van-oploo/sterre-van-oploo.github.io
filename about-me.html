                    <p>Hi! My name is Sterre. I'm diving in the front-end web develop world with glasses of creativity! I'm most familiar with HTML and CSS, I'm learning to work with javaScript and I have done some projects in other languages like C# java. I love art (and making art!), being creative, trying to make new things and <i>thinking outside the box</i>. I'm currently studying at the sintLucas in Eindhoven, following a web development and a cambridge course. I've been programming since 2022 and have been learning and growing ever since! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>about my art</b>
                    <br>
                    My passion to express myself expands across a bunch of mediums. I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil, in 2020 I had bought an ipad and a apple pencil to try digital art, which never really <i>clicked</i> the way that it did with traditional art, but that way I got into a bit of mediocre animation. I also play guitar and (try to) make my own music! I also do photography and video editing. I even have some projects that combine all of the above!

                    <p>My first idea was to have the timeline as the home page, you could scroll through it. The problem was that I did not like the design, colors and there was no place for buttons so I started over</p>
